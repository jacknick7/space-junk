# SPACE JUNK
Welcome to SPACE JUNK, a not-so-great game about helping the safety of space travel by disintegrating space junk in the near future.

After decades of not worrying about space junk formed by collisions between satellites and other human-made objects, space travel has become a dangerous undertaking. As a member of the Ben Net Organization (BNO), your job is simple, clean up space by disintegrating as much space junk as you can.
